# Dermatology Disease Classification

## Overview
This project classifies six different dermatological diseases using machine learning. The dataset was explored using data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand feature distributions and relationships.

Two models were built and compared:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

---

## Dataset
The dataset is located in the data folder:
- dermatology_database_1.csv

It contains clinical and histopathological features used to predict six dermatological disease classes.

---

## Methods
The following steps were performed:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization of features
- Model training using Decision Tree and Random Forest
- Model evaluation using classification reports
- Visualization of feature importances

---

## Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using classification reports including:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Accuracy

---

## Feature Importance
Feature importance plots were generated to identify the most influential features, mainly from the Random Forest model.
